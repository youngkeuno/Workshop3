I wrote a function called RandomCircle100 that takes no input and returns a circle with a radius of 100 and a random center point. I then wrote a function called DrawUntilClick that keeps making random circles until the user clicks. I then made a function called AlternateColors that takes in a circle as an input and repeatedly changes the color of that circle from red to blue until the user clicks on the screen. My next function is called ManyColoredCircles which gets mouse clicks from the user. If the user clicks on the top left of the screen versus the top right of the screen, a different color circle will be made. If the user clicks on the bottom of the screen, the function will stop making circles. I then made a function called MoveRight which takes a circle as input and slowly moves the circle right until it reaches the edge of the window. I then made a function called MoveLeft which does the same thing in the other direction. My last function was called BackAndForth which makes a circle and moves it back and forth from left to right forever.
